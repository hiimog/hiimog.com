<h1>Logging Fundamentals</h1>
<p>Writing production-grade software is not just about crafting efficient algorithms or user-friendly interfaces; 
it's also about the ability to diagnose and mitigate problems swiftly as they arise. Sometimes your code is buggy, 
but other times the problem lies with some misbehaving dependency in the broader software ecosystem. To tackle these challenges, 
developers commonly rely on two main tools: metrics and logs. While metrics offer numerical insights—like response 
time or queue lengths—logs provide a more detailed narrative of system behavior. When implemented effectively, 
logs can be the critical difference between a catastrophe and a bump in the road.

Logs come in two kinds: unstructured and structured. Unstructured logs are typically lines of text with some loose
pattern where each line represents a distinct entry. Some examples:
<ul>
    <li>Common Log Format: <code class="inline">127.0.0.1 user-identifier frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326</code></li>
    <li>Syslog: <code class="inline">&lt;34&gt;1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com su - ID47 - BOM'su root' failed for lonvick on /dev/pts/8</code></li>
    <li>Common Event Format: <code class="inline">CEF:0|Trend Micro|Deep Security Manager|<DSM version>|600|User Signed In|3|src=10.52.116.160 suser=admin target=admin msg=User signed in from 2001:db8::5</code></li>
</ul>
As you can see, there is a lot of information embedded in these lines
